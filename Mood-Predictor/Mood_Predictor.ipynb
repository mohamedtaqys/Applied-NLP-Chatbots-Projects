        "Mood-Predictor is a conversational AI chatbot that uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and predict a user's mood based on their responses. The tool employs TextBlob, a powerful NLP library, to perform sentiment analysis and assess the emotional tone of text input. By asking users a series of simple questions, it determines whether the user is feeling happy, sad, or neutral.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. The bot introduces itself and prepares the user for the questions.\n",
        "2. These are the three questions the bot will ask to understand the user's mood:\n",
        "  - \"How are you feeling today? (Please describe your mood in a sentence)\",\n",
        "  - \"What was the highlight of your day?\",\n",
        "  - \"Is there anything bothering you?\"\n",
        "3. The program collects user responses and stores them in a list called answers.\n",
        "4. The individual responses are combined into a single string of text (user_text), which will be analyzed for sentiment.\n",
        "5. The TextBlob object (blob) is created using the combined text. The polarity value determines the sentiment of the text:\n",
        "  - Polarity ranges from -1 (negative) to 1 (positive).\n",
        "  - Neutral responses typically have a polarity score close to 0.\n",
        "6. Based on the polarity score, the mood is classified into three categories:\n",
        "  - Happy: If the polarity is greater than 0.1.\n",
        "  - Sad: If the polarity is less than -0.1.\n",
        "  - Neutral: If the polarity is between -0.1 and 0.1.\n",
        "7. The bot informs the user of its prediction based on their responses.\n",
        "8. Depending on the detected mood, the bot responds with an appropriate message.\n",
        "  - Happy: Positive and uplifting messages.\n",
        "  - Sad: Supportive and encouraging messages.\n",
        "  - Neutral: Calm and balanced responses.\n",
        "9. The bot ends the conversation with a positive note, thanking the user for sharing their feelings."
