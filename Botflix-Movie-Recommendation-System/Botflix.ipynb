        "# **Botflix - Movie Recommendation System**\n",
        "Botflix is a movie recommendation system designed to help users discover movies they might enjoy. It uses content-based filtering to recommend movies based on genres and provides additional functionalities like searching for movies, suggesting random movies, and finding top movies by theme. The system is interactive and user-friendly, making it easy for users to explore and find their next favorite movie.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Features\n",
        "1. Movie Recommendations:\n",
        "  - Recommends movies similar to a given movie based on genres.\n",
        "  - Displays detailed information about each recommended movie, including:\n",
        "    - Title\n",
        "    - Genres\n",
        "    - Release Date\n",
        "    - Runtime\n",
        "    - Rating\n",
        "    - Overview (description)\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Top-N Movies by Theme:\n",
        "  Displays the top-rated movies in a specific genre or theme (e.g., Action, Comedy, Drama).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Advanced Search:\n",
        "  Allows users to search for movies by:\n",
        "    - Title: Search for movies by their title.\n",
        "    - Year: Search for movies released in a specific year.\n",
        "    - Actor: Search for movies featuring a specific actor.\n",
        "    - Rating: Search for movies with a minimum rating.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Random Movie Suggestion:\n",
        "  Suggests a random movie with all its details.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Interactive Chatbot:\n",
        "  - Provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system.\n",
        "  - Guides users through the available functionalities.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## How It Works\n",
        "1. Content-Based Filtering:\n",
        "- The system uses TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to analyze the genres of movies.\n",
        "- It computes cosine similarity between movies based on their genres to find similar movies.\n",
        "2. Data Preprocessing:\n",
        "- The genres column in the dataset is cleaned and converted into a list of genre names.\n",
        "- Missing or invalid data is handled gracefully.\n",
        "3. User Interaction:\n",
        "- Users interact with the system through a chatbot interface.\n",
        "- They can choose from various options like getting recommendations, searching for movies, or getting a random movie suggestion.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Technologies Used\n",
        "- Python: The core programming language used for the project.\n",
        "- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.\n",
        "- NumPy: For numerical computations.\n",
        "- Scikit-learn: For TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity.\n",
        "- Random Module: For suggesting random movies.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Dataset\n",
        "The project uses the TMDB 5000 Movies Dataset, which contains information about 5000 movies, including:\n",
        "- Title\n",
        "- Genres\n",
        "- Release Date\n",

The trial and the events surrounding it are seen through the eyes of Finch's six-year-old daughter, Scout. While Robinson's trial gives the movie its momentum, there are plenty of anecdotal occurrences before and after the court date: Scout's ever-strengthening bond with older brother, Jem, her friendship with precocious young Dill Harris, her father's no-nonsense reactions to such life-and-death crises as a rampaging mad dog, and especially Scout's reactions to, and relationship with, Boo Radley, the reclusive 'village idiot' who turns out to be her salvation when she is attacked by a venomous bigot.\n",

Interviews with employees and former employees of such companies as Halliburton, CACI, and KBR suggest that government cronyism is behind apparent \"sweetheart\" deals that give such contractors enormous freedom to profit from supplying support and material to American troops while providing little oversight. Survivors of employees who were killed discuss the claim that the companies cared more for profit than for the welfare of their own workers, and soldiers indicate that the quality of services provided is sub-standard and severely in contradiction to the comparatively huge profits being generated. Also depicted are the unsuccessful attempts by the filmmakers to get company spokesmen to respond to the charges made by the interviewees.\n",

Call + Response goes deep undercover where slavery is thriving from the child brothels of Cambodia to the slave brick kilns of rural India to reveal that in 2007, Slave Traders made more money than Google, Nike and Starbucks combined. Luminaries on the issue and many other prominent political and cultural figures offer first hand account of this 21st century trade. Performances from Grammy-winning and critically acclaimed artists move this chilling information into inspiration for stopping it. Music is part of the movement against human slavery. Dr. Cornel West connects the music of the American slave fields to the popular music we listen to today, and offers this connection as a rallying cry for the modern abolitionist movement currently brewing.\n",
